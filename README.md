## HI
- 👀 I'm a bioinformatician, currently working on vaccine R&D, and previously studied microbic genomics, metagenomics, transcriptomics and phylogenetics, etc.
- ✨ I have hands-on experience in the analysis of single-cell data, including single-cell/single-nuclei RNAseq and ATACseq, which I have demonstrated in various projects and on my personal website at https://sun-xinh.github.io/Sun_xinhao.io/.
- 🌱 I'm currently hunting for an internship.
- 📫 How to reach me? By email: realwilliam_sun@outlook.com
- 💞️ I'm grateful to users who have greatly helped to report bugs and suggest new features. I may respond to issues or fix bugs quickly, but not always on time. Thanks for checking out my profile!
